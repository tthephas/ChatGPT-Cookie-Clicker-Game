# ChatGPT-Cookie-Clicker-Game

Simple cookie clicker game made with chat GPT in about 30 minutes

The AI did ok but had trouble with the scoring system, especially after adding levels and accelerators

Had to keep going back and fixing small bugs and feeding all code back to the AI model

Overall worked fairly well though and had a simple game going in just a few minutes
